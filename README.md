### created using react


#### other dependencies:
* Axios

#### Purpose of this app
The purpose of this app was to get comfortable with http requests, this app allowed me to do that and figure out how to deal with the data that I recieved. at first I wrote this app to fetch quotes using the standard **fetch API** however once completed I went back and converted the requests to **Axios**, this was a great way to see and try out both solutions.

#### What I learned
I learned a lot about handling data and this was the first of my small apps where I encountered the problem of having to lift up the state multiple times to allow all components to access it, this could have been solved by something like redux but I felt that the app was not large enough to warrant something quite that extreme. 

#### What improvements could be made
Would be a good idea to scope the CSS by using a different type like CSS modules or Tailwind.
